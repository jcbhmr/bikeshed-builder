# Bikeshed builder

ðŸš² Bundles Bikeshed for use without Python & pip

## Installation

â„¹ These installation steps will install **the Bikeshed project** itself (the `bikeshed` binary), not the builder infrastructure metapackage.

You can install Bikeshed straight from [the GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/jcbhmr/bikeshed-builder/releases/latest) or by using the `install.sh` script which will automagicallyâœ¨ choose the right binary for your platform.
